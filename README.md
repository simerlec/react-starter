# Opinionated React Starter

## Setup

### Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, eslint

[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) is used for code-formatting - added to a [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) hook that's executed on every commit via lint-staged.

ESlint is used to keep us from making mistakes.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:1234/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Powered by [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) ❤️
